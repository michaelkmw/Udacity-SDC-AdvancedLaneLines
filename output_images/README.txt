This folder contains a series of images that are generated by the Test Image Pipeline in P2.ipynb file

The images are generated using the source images in test_images folder. They share the same names as the source images except with prefix to indicate the processing that has been applied to them

1. undist_ prefix indicates that camera distortion has been corrected
2. grad_ prefix indicates that gradient thresholding has been applied to the source image
3. color_ prefix indicates that color thresholding has been applied to the source image
3. combined_ prefix combines both gradient and color thresholding
        red color is contributed by color thresholding
        green color is contributed by gradient thresholding
4. warped_ prefix indicates that the thresholded image has been perspective transformed to birds-eye view
5. detected_ prefix indicates that lane finding through sliding window algorithm has been applied to the source image
6. final_ prefix indicates the final output of the image processing pipeline with lane highlighted in green and lane information displayed in upper left corner
